# *.janet files in the plugin dir) doesn't load it as plugin code.
# Loads the plugin files in the host's load order into one env (no
# `harness/*` needed — the compressor functions are pure), then asserts
# the head+tail truncation invariants. Not a cargo test (these run in
# the Janet worker, not Rust), but keeps the behavior pinned and
# locally verifiable. The PR that added compression shipped its tests
# in an external gist; this brings coverage in-repo.
